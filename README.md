## Global Terrorism Database Study

### Overview
This project leverages the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) to conduct a comprehensive analysis of terrorist incidents worldwide. Using Python and data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the study aims to uncover insights into patterns, trends, and contributing factors in terrorism over time.

### Key Points Covered
- **Data Source**: The Global Terrorism Database (GTD), maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), provides detailed information on terrorist incidents worldwide.
  
- **Analysis Goals**: The project aims to:
  - Identify geographical and temporal trends in terrorist activities.
  - Analyze attack types, weapons used, and targets to understand modus operandi.
  - Investigate factors contributing to terrorism, such as socioeconomic conditions or political instability.
  
- **Methodology**: Utilizes Python for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization. Statistical techniques and machine learning models may be employed for deeper insights and predictions.

### Usage
- **Setup**: Clone the repository and ensure Python and required libraries are installed.
  
- **Execution**: Run Python scripts to preprocess data, analyze trends, and visualize results. Jupyter Notebooks may be used for interactive exploration.
